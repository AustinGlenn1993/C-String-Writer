Good evening everyone!
My name is Austin Woods and I am very excited to present to you my very first C++ application with a concentration on text writing to files
I have written a file to test the capabilities of the fstream library
This text will be a basis for saving and loading data to a file in order to utilize this feature with Unreal Eninge 4

Thank you for reading!
Goodnight everyone!
